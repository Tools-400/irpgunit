## Credits

The iRPGUnit plug-in uses a fork of the [RPGUnit](https://sourceforge.net/projects/rpgunit/) library, which was started by Lacton back in September 2006.

Some bugs have been fixed and Mihael Schmidt at [RPG Next Gen](http://www.rpgnextgen.com/http://www.rpgnextgen.com/) added an interface to the IBM Rational Developer for i and started developing the iRPGUnit plug-in. I took over the project and widely enhanced the plug-in. Now the project is supported by Mihael and me.
